Testing user stories


Responsiveness 


Audit tests within Google Developer Tools 



- I've tested the website on several devices including  : 


 Slack 'Peer Review' channel for feedback.

- I ran my website through [GTmetrix](https://gtmetrix.com) and it presented me with speed issues I had not been given on Google Developer Tools. It outlined that some of the images had been resized within the IDE so their native pixel ratio was still far too large, and I could save space by resizing these on top of the compression I had already applied.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

    Contact form:
        Go to the "Contact Us" page
        Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
        Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
        Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.


This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).
